/*
 3.10.25. Date
 The Date type is a type that represents an instant in time with millisecond accuracy.
 The instants in time that this type can represent are the same that can be represented with
 ECMAScript Date objects ([ECMA-262], section 15.9.1.1) – namely, every millisecond in the
 200,000,000 days centered around midnight of 1 January, 1970 UTC, except for any millisecond
 that is part of an inserted leap second, because they cannot be represented by this type.

 An additional value that this type can represent is one that indicates an indeterminate
 or undefined time, which we write as undefined.

 There is no way to represent a constant Date value in IDL.

 The type name of the Date type is “Date”.
