/**
The any type is the union of all other possible non-union types.
Its type name is “Any”.
The any type is like a discriminated union type, in that each of
its values has a specific non-any type associated with it. 
For example, one value of the any type is the unsigned long 150, 
while another is the long 150. These are distinct values.
The particular type of an any value is known as its specific type.
(Values of union types also have specific types.)
