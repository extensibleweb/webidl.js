/**
 * 3.10.15. DOMString
 * The DOMString type corresponds to the set of all possible sequences of code units. Such sequences are commonly interpreted as UTF-16 encoded strings
 * [RFC2781] although this is not required. While DOMString is defined to be an OMG IDL boxed sequence<unsigned short> valuetype in DOM Level 3 Core
 * ([DOM3CORE], section 1.2.1), this document defines DOMString to be an intrinsic type so as to avoid special casing that sequence type in various
 * situations where a string is required.
 *
 * The type name of the DOMString type is “String”.
 *
 * Note
 * Note also that null is not a value of type DOMString. To allow null, a nullable DOMString, written as DOMString? in IDL, needs to be used.
