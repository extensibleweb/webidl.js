# webidl.js

An implementation of [WebIDL](http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/WebIDL/) in [ECMAScript](http://es5.github.com/).

## Goals and Scope

The initial goal of this project is to implement a "prollyfill" code generator based on the [WebIDL](http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/WebIDL/) specification in [ECMAScript](http://es5.github.com/) (i.e., implement the [WebIDL ECMAScript bindings](http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/WebIDL/#ecmascript-binding)). 

For the first version, webidl.js will take as input well-formed Web IDL and generate JavaScript code that: 

  1.  Implements the given WebIDL in conformance to WebIDL's [WebIDL ECMAScript bindings](http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/WebIDL/#ecmascript-binding).
  2.  can be eval'ed immediately to implement a noop object.
  3.  can be used indepedently of webidl.js. 

The generated code will not depend on any external libraries. 

#Proposed Architecture (in WebIDL)
WebIDLCompiler will be based on Robin Berjon's [WebIDL Parser](https://github.com/darobin/webidl2.js), 

```
interface WebIDLCompiler : WebIDL{
    static DOMString compile(DOMString dataFragment);
    static DOMString compile(object dataTree);
}

interface WebIDL{
    static object parse(); 
}
```
Where ```WebIDL``` is and instance of [https://github.com/darobin/webidl2.js](https://github.com/darobin/webidl2.js)

##Examples of what we want to do
(The following examples are hypothetical, as we don't actually have any running code yet! :) )

Given some WebIDL, like: 

```JavaScript
interface Vehicle {
    attribute DOMString make;
    attribute DOMString model;
    void move();
}

[Constructor, Constructor(DOMString make, optional DOMString model)]
interface Car : Vehicle {
     const octet maxspeed = 200;
     void drive([Clamp] octet speed);
};
```

webidl.js will implement the following in the browser: 

```JavaScript

var webIDL = new WebIDLCompiler();

//convert to javascript
var script = webIDL.compile(carIDLString);
eval(script); // noop methods by default

// interfaces are added to the global scope
console.log(window.Car);
console.log(window.Vehicle);
console.log(window.Car.prototype.drive);
console.log(Car.maxspeed === 200); 

// instances are valid and inheritance works properly
var car = new Car(); 
console.log(car instanceof window.Car === true); 
console.log(car instanceof window.Vehicle === true); 
console.log("make" in car === true); 
console.log("move" in car === true); 

// methods can be called on instances
car.drive();
window.Car.prototype.drive.call(car)

// methods can't be called on other objects (throws a type error)
try{ 
    window.Car.prototype.drive.call({}); 
}catch(e){
  console.log(e);
} 

// type checking is built-in (throws a type error)
try{ 
  car.drive({});
}catch(e){
  console.log(e);
} 

// type conversion is also buit-in
car.drive("100"); 
```

All pull requests are reviewed prior to being integrated.

To retain a high level of quality, we require that all contributed code include:
 * appropriate unit tests, 
 * documentation, 
 * and the code has been [linted](http://www.jshint.com/).
  
Linting, beautificaiton, and generation of documentation is handled by [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)..
 
## Coding conventions
We attempt to adhere to the [Google JavaScript Style Guide](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javascriptguide.xml). 

We are also moving to us [JSDoc](http://code.google.com/p/jsdoc-toolkit/) to document out code. 

Before submitting code, please be sure to run [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).
